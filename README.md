# Automated Data Validation & Web Testing with Selenium & Pytest  

## Project Overview  
This project automates **data validation and web testing** using Python, Selenium, and Pytest.  
It is based on **real restaurant data** collected from past work experience, ensuring **practical, real-world applications**.  
Since testing on live websites can be challenging, a **test site** was used for Selenium-based automation.  

###  Main Components
1️⃣ **Data Validation (`validate_data.py` & `validate_data.ipynb`)**  
   - Ensures that dataset values (e.g., customer orders, prices, drink options) meet expected criteria.  
   - Identifies and reports errors in structured data.  

2️⃣ **Automated Data Testing (`test_validation.py` & `test_validation.ipynb`)**  
   - Uses `pytest` to automate testing for dataset validation.  
   - Confirms that price values are positive, drink values are valid, and required fields are present.  

3️⃣ **Automated Web Testing (`test_login1.py` & `test_login1.ipynb`)**  
   - Uses Selenium WebDriver to automate UI testing of a login page.  
   - Tests both **successful login** and **failed login with an incorrect password** scenarios.  

4️⃣ **Data Validation & Test Results (`Restaurant_data_validation_pytest_result.ipynb`)**  
   - Jupyter Notebook documenting the **validation and testing process**, including test results.  
   - Demonstrates the outcomes of both data validation and Pytest-based tests.

##  Project Goals
✅ Automate **data validation** for structured datasets  
✅ Implement **unit tests** with `pytest` to ensure data integrity  
✅ Develop **UI automation tests** for web applications using Selenium  
✅ Gain hands-on experience with **QA Automation & test-driven development (TDD)**
